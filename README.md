## Professional Profile - Full Stack Developer <img src="https://emojis.directory/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/microsoft-teams-gifs_rocket_1f680.png" width="25px"></a>:
I am Tim√≥teo, a Full Stack Developer with a solid technical background in Systems Development (SESI SENAI). I possess the capability to build and manage complete applications, from the user interface to the data infrastructure.

With proficiency in HTML5 and CSS3, my focus is on constructing modern, responsive, and accessible user interfaces, always prioritizing User Experience (UX) and application performance.

My strong foundation in JavaScript allows me to deliver efficient and scalable solutions. I am currently in an intensive process of deepening my knowledge in modern JavaScript (ES6+ and Asynchronous Programming), actively applying this knowledge to mobile development using React Native. To ensure robust and scalable code, I am also enhancing my skills with TypeScript. Furthermore, practical experience with Python and PostgreSQL enables me to work across the entire development stack: from Back-End logic to database management.

To complement my technical vision, I am broadening my understanding of business and systems architecture through a course in Systems Analysis and Development, always aiming to align technology with strategic market needs.

Key Differentiators
Full Stack Vision and Experience: I possess a comprehensive understanding of the entire software development lifecycle‚Äîfrom Front-End design to Back-End integration and database optimization‚Äîallowing me to propose more integrated and efficient solutions.

Strategic Focus on Mobile: My current investment in mastering Modern JavaScript and React Native demonstrates a clear commitment to expanding my capabilities into native and cross-platform mobile application development.

Focus on Performance and Accessibility: I believe a successful application must be fast and accessible to all users, regardless of device or ability, and I apply this philosophy at every development stage.

Proactive and Continuous Learning: I am always seeking new technologies and best practices. My current journey, with a focus on React Native and TypeScript, ensures that the solutions I deliver are innovative and future-proof.

I am actively seeking opportunities that allow me to apply and deepen my Full Stack expertise, contributing to the strategic growth of teams and businesses, while challenging myself and growing professionally in the mobile ecosystem.
