## About Me <img src="https://emojis.directory/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/microsoft-teams-gifs_rocket_1f680.png" width="25px"></a>:

Iâ€™m TimÃ³teo, a Front-End Developer with a strong technical background in Systems Development (SESI SENAI) and a solid proficiency in HTML5 and CSS3. My goal is to build modern, responsive, and accessible user interfaces, always focusing on user experience and application performance.

With a strong foundation in JavaScript, Iâ€™m committed to delivering efficient, scalable solutions for Front-End development. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with Python and PostgreSQL, allowing me to work across the full development stack, from Back-End to database management.

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my skills into mobile development with React Native, and enhancing my code scalability and robustness with TypeScript. Iâ€™m also deepening my business and system architecture knowledge through a course in Systems Analysis and Development, always striving to align technology with market needs.

What Sets Me Apart

Full Stack Development: Beyond Front-End, I have experience with Back-End and database integration, offering a comprehensive understanding of the entire software development lifecycle.

Performance & Accessibility Focused: I believe a successful application is one that is fast and accessible to all users, regardless of device or ability.

Continuous Learning: I am always on the lookout for new technologies and best practices to improve my code quality and deliver innovative solutions.

Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities that allow me to apply my expertise, while also learning and growing with new challenges. My goal is to contribute to teams and business growth in a strategic way.
